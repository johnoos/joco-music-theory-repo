            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p> It has been proven in Stellenbosch, among other places, that music theory can 
                effectively and innovatively be taught online.
                This is true for private tuition as well as for institutionalised education.  
                We have experience in using the online tools  
                and believe that it is appropriate and effective    
                for current and future times.

                At the outset, a grade level and exam body (Trinity College, UNISA, ABRSM) are selected 
                based on the learner's aspirations and the Reference Sheet shown  
                under 'Music theory levels' in the menu.
                Objectives are discussed and documented, and progress is tracked on a 
                quarterly basis. Adult beginners are welcome. Refer to the menu item for fees.
            </p>

                Candy and John Oosthuizen are based in Stellenbosch and have both recently 
                studied at the local university Music Department where they attained 
                qualifications appropriate for the level of tuition offered - refer to the menu.  
                For learners that would like to combine theory and practical tuition, guitar, piano, and 
                organ lessons can be offered by special arrangement. 
                In the roles of university music tutor, community outreach tutor, and 
                music ministry leader, we have assisted many people to acquire musicianship skills.
